The serine protease preprint is up on [biorxiv][sp].

This study tried to trace the evolution of one of the most ubiquitous venom components across animals, the serine protease (SP) based venoms. Both mammals and reptiles actively use SP toxins in their venom. However, it was believed that these components evolved independently in both lineages. Following the revelation of a conserved gene regulatory network behind oral secretions, we wondered if the toxins could also be conserved or have a common origin.

We found that SP-based toxins in reptiles and mammals descended from a single ancient gene that shares its ancestor with fish anionic trypsins. This new result will change a decades-long misconception that constraint and convergence lead to the rise of similar toxins across lineages. Instead, we show that parallel evolution from a common ancestor is likely to be a good source of adaptive novelty. 

Stay tuned to this space to find out moreâ€¦.
