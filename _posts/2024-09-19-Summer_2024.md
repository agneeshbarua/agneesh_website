The summer of 2024 has been incredibly rewarding on the research front. I had the pleasure of attending the Euro Evo-Devo conference in Helsinki, where I presented in the symposium on methods and theories of predictive evo-devo. As someone who transitioned into the Evo-Devo field, it was inspiring to hear about the latest fascinating research and to see firsthand how vibrant and thriving this community is.  

In addition, I was honored to be featured in the [post-doctoral spotlight][jez] of the *Journal of Experimental Zoology Part B (JEZ-B)*. My journey into Evo-Devo began with reading some of the captivating reviews and papers published in JEZ-B, so being featured in this journal feels special. I am more motivated than ever to make meaningful contributions to this dynamic field.
